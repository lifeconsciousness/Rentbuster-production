            Hi. My name is Shane. I have lived in NL for 14 years and, like a lot of people, I rent my home from a landlord. I founded Rent Buster NL in 2022 after seeing first-hand the outrageous rental prices being asked by Makelaars/landlords in response to the Dutch housing shortage.  My goal is to seek out
            and alert renters who moved into new apartments/ studios/ rooms in the Netherlands that their landlord may be overcharging them. 
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0;">
            While there may be a massive shortage of housing in major cities, a large portion of the rental market is still subject to rent-regulation to
            ensure basic housing is affordable. Some landlords and estate agents ignore these price controls and grossly inflate the asking rent price
            of accommodation. Tenants are frequently unaware of their right to a rent reduction/fee refund or are too afraid to take action for fear of eviction, and are stuck paying thousands of euro extra per year. 
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
            I aim to inform and help as many of these tenants as possible via social media and mail. If you received a letter from me, then you likely are overpaying. Check out our FAQ for more information or send me a message for help.
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>The landlord/agency that has rented out the accommodation to you posted advertisements on popular housing websites that I check frequently. Your house/apartment was red-flagged as having suspiciously high rent. I performed a calculation and determined an approximate maximum rent price that you see in the letter. If the difference between this and the current rent price is within an acceptable level of accuracy, then I send a letter to your address a few weeks after the beginning of the contract. I do not know the name of the tenant or anything about the contract you signed. </p>

              <p>In 2024, I set up an anonymous hotline/form for people to report rental situations that they were concerned about. If the situation was suspicious enough or there was something that I felt warranted contacting the tenant, I posted a letter. For legal reasons, I avoid giving too many details in the letter because it often happens that the landlord/owner intercepts these letters either by accident or deliberately. </p>

            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">Is there a database that tells me what the max legal rent for any address is?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>Unfortunately no, it must be calculated by hand. It varies depending on many factors and changes every year due to fluctuations in the house prices, the layout, the energy rating etc. The gemeente in Rotterdam and Utrecht offer a rudimentary calculator on their websites but they only calculate a possible range of values and only within their respective cities. You can also use my calculator at the top of the page.

            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">I think I am paying too much for my room/house/apartment but it took me months to find this place and I don't want to upset the landlord and get kicked out for causing trouble. I would rather pay extra than lose this place. What will happen if I complain?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>That is understandable. Finding places to rent in the Netherlands is difficult and it is possible that undertaking this procedure will sour the relationship between you and the landlord. If you do have a temporary contract, it is possible to wait until your contract becomes permanent before initiating the procedure. To prevent abuse, the Huurcommissie gives tenants more flexibility with the deadline for asking for a rent reduction (up to six months after the end of the temporary contract). Once your contract becomes permanent (or you leave) every thing you overpaid can be refunded to you.
                <br style="margin-bottom: 0.7rem;"> Also this is only if you have fixed term contract (less than 2 years) and you want to stay longer. If you have a fixed-term contract and you are sure you want to leave at the end of it, then you have no added risk to eviction. If you have an indefinite contract then the landlord will be powerless to evict you for appealing the rent price. You will likely be able to stay there as long as you want. Should the landlord try to evict you, you will have an arsenal of tenant rights to fall back on to prevent your this. As long as you keep your nose clean there should be no reason your landlord can evict you and most CERTAINLY not because you exercised your rights as a tenant.

          <div class="accordion" id="a6">
            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">Okay, so what is your end in all this?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>I have had personal experience with dealing with bad landlords who overcharge tenants. I dont like to see people get taken advantage of and I want to do something about it. Unfortunately it is not free to do this. I do want to do this full-time and, unfortunately, I am not a salaried employee of a rental organization. Operating a website, researching properties and sending letters costs money and I do have to pay my own rent and eat. Every amount donated helps me alert the next tenant who might be a position similar to you. If your approach to this arrangement is "Screw everyone else, I got mine" then Rentbuster is not the service for you.  With regard to how much, that is determined by you: I operate on money you donate from a successful settlement. If I am successful, I may be saving you thousands of euro per year. You can decide how much my services were worth to you. Please note that similar organizations, such as Bumarang, demand for a large cut of the settlement (>50%) in exchange for the same service. Joke donations are not accepted and will be refunded out of principle. As for guidelines on how much to give: some people give 10% of the refunded amount, other give 5%, some give 1 month difference of the old to new rent price. </p>

            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">Why don't I just go to a rental organization? Why do I need you at all?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>There are indeed many organizations that can help you with dealing with your landlord. Some of them charge for their services. They are also reactionary: They only respond to requests rather than the proactive approach taken by Rent Buster NL in seeking out tenants who don not know they are overpaying.
                <br style="margin-bottom: 0.7rem;"> Of course you are perfectly capable of building your own case against your landlord. In fact, it is good that you show this initiative because the more people that do this, the better. My services are for those of you who dont have the time, energy or knowledge to deal with the paperwork, the back and forth with the landlord or the research required.</p>

            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">Your letter told me that I might have paid an illegal agency fee. Is this not normal?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>Nope, it is not normal. According to a 2016 Supreme Court ruling, a makelaar/estate agent is forbidden from representing both sides in a contract. They can only accept payment from the side that they represent. If you found the ad for the apartment you live in on a website, this means that the landlord has already engaged the makelaar's services
			   and can only accept payment from him/her. Any fees charged to the tenant other than the rent are forbidden. This includes : key money, admin fees, registration fees, contract costs. There are many euphemisms for it. Most agencies do not charge these fees anymore but some are still trying to sneak them into the transaction, particularly if expats, who dont know the rules, are involved </p>

            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">What do you mean when you say 'busting/unbustable'?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>Busting is the process of getting the rent price reduced on your home at the Huurcommissie. An apartment/studio is bustable if it scores below 187pt (July 2024-June 2025) or has a projected new rent price of less than of approx. 1150 euro. If it is big (>80sqm) and very energy efficient (label A), then it likely will score too many points and be a Vrij/Free Sector (Unbustable)</p>

            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">I am looking for a bustable place to live. Can you find me a place?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>Unfortunately not. I am the last person you want looking for a place for you. It is possible I am known to some Makelaars and doubt they have anything nice to say about me. If I ask them on your behalf for a place to live, they would likely suspect I was asking so I could bust the place later. However I do provide a weekly list of potentially bustable homes on my subreddit called the Hotsheets. You can find the link to my subreddit at the bottom of the page.</p>

              <p>Call me. Until I get the Youtube channel up and running to answer these types of questions, the best thing I can offer is a conversation. I enjoy the distraction. Most of my day is spent looking at excel spreadsheets and Pararius ads.</p>

            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">My apartment/studio does not have energy label. Is that bad?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>An energy label is an important document that states how energy efficient your apartment/studio is. By law, the landlord is required to provide this to you when you move in. Many landlords dont have this document and since July 2024, they can be punished for this in a Huurcommissie case by having a label they obtained after you moved in excluded. This could mean a saving of 200 euro per month on your rent for this oversight. The Dutch Supreme court ruled in June 2023 that this was unfair to the landlord, particularly if the living space was energy efficient so in principle the energy label could be included but it is determined on a case by case basis. I will alert you to the risks involved in this during your case.</p>

              <p>COROP is a special designation that new or extensively renovated small (<40sqm) apartments/studios in Amsterdam and Utrecht get. If you live in a very new (Built after 2018) or very energy efficient building (A+++), your rent price is likely unbustable. I will of course check to make sure it qualifies.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>On July 1 2024, the Affordable Rent Act (Wet Betaalbare Huur) came into effect. This law makes approximately 90% of the private rental market homes bustable. The law also has consequences for tenants who moved into their Free Sector home before July 1 2024. If you missed the deadline to bust your home, a windows of opportunity opens up on July 1 2025 when you can ask your landlord to reduce your rent price if your property score <144 pts under the current points systems. For anyone who signed their contract on or after July 1 2024 and who may have missed their chance to bust, you can also bust your home though you dont need to wait until July 1 2025. You also have a much higher points limit (<187pts). Contact me without delay.  </p>

 <div class="accordion" >
            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">Who are BPW and why are you recommending that I get membership?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>Bond Precaire Woonvormen (BPW) are a tenant rights group who step in to defend tenants when there is a risk of violence/intimidation by the landlord in response to a rent reduction case. Often small landlords react badly to a tenant preceived to be using the law to get a rent reduction. I have seen cases where tenants are threatened with murder, assaulted, bullied and threatened by their landlord or their proxies. Certain large landlords like Marcel van Hooijonk are notorious for this type of behavior. BPW can help out but they need advance notification to gather members to take action. Though BPW are also a volunteer organization, they still require money to function and I personally dislike sending them cases where it is already too late for them to take effective action because the tenant was not yet a member. In certain cases, I will refuse to file your case at the Huurcommissie if I think there is a reasonable chance the landlord will resort to violent behavior for your own safety until you become a member of BPW or agree to let me contact them for you. The more dodgy and outright illegal your lease agreement is, the greater the chance that the landlord will resort to these actions. I also recommend people get Legal insurance/ Rechtsbijstandverzekering for the similar reasons.   </p>
